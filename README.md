  Gatsby starter for Node.js server with Express and `gatsby-plugin-nodejs`
</h2>

### Getting started ðŸš€

1. You can build a typical Gatsby site, with client-side routes and redirects as you would normally do.
2. The Express-based server is placed inside `server/index.js` file. You can build a typical Node.js app, as you would normally do.
3. `gatsby-plugin-nodejs` will take care of all thing about serving the site, creating redirects, 404 page or client-side routes.
4. The server runs along with `gatsby develop` and `gatsby build`, so you can use your custom built routes in the site.
5. To create the production build, run `gatsby build` and next, to run the server, just use `npm start`.
6. For more info about using `gatsby-plugin-nodejs`, refer to its [documentation](https://github.com/AdamSiekierski/gatsby-plugin-nodejs#readme).
